Polymorphism
______________________________________________________________________________________

Poly means many  Morphisam means forms

one thing can behave in many ways.

Compiletime-polymorphism / Overloading/ early Binding

                   runtime polymorphism/ Overloading / late binding

--> A method having same name but different paramters is known as overloading.

Automatic Promotion in Overloading :
------------------------------------------------
We can pass the int value to the double paramters in the method it will automatically convert the int value to double
value if method of that doesnt exists throws error.

--> If overloading if the compiler is unable to find the method with exact match we wont get any compile time error
    immediatly.
--> 1st compier promotes the arguments to the next level and checks whether the mathced method is avaliable or not
    if it is avaliable then that method will be considered. if it is not avaliable then compiler promotes the argument once again
    to the next level .This process will be continued until all possible promotions still is the method matched method is not
    avalible then we will get compiletime error. This process ia called "Automatic Promotion Overloading".


Constructor Overloading :
------------------------------------------------------------
A class can contain more than one constructor and all this constructor having the same name but different paramaters(or arguments)
and hence these constructors considered as "Overloaded constructors".
